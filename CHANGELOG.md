and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- [Helm] Ability to specify deployment (rollout) strategy and switch from 'Recreate' to 'RollingUpdate' by default.

## [0.19.0] - 2025-09-17

### Added

- [Helm] Ability to opt out of the PodMonitor CR.
- [Helm] Ability to use more than 1 replica.

## [0.18.0] - 2025-07-15

### Added

- Add multi-tenancy infrastructure and configuration support for Alertmanager with configurable tenant extraction and backward compatibility.

## [0.17.0] - 2025-07-02

### Added

- Add advanced filtering capabilities for both v1alpha1 and v1alpha2 controllers:
  - Add silence selector feature to filter `Silence` resources by labels (configure via `--silence-selector` flag).
  - Add namespace selector for v1alpha2 controller to restrict watched namespaces (configure via `--namespace-selector` flag).
- Allow filtering of `Silence` custom resources based on a label selector. The operator will only process `Silence` CRs that match the selector provided via the `--silence-selector` command-line flag or the `silenceSelector` Helm chart value. If no selector is provided, all `Silence` CRs are processed.
- Add new `observability.giantswarm.io/v1alpha2` API with namespace-scoped Silence CRD for improved multi-tenancy.
  - Add `MatchType` enum field using Alertmanager operator symbols (`=`, `!=`, `=~`, `!~`) for intuitive matching logic.
  - Add `SilenceV2Reconciler` controller to handle v1alpha2 resources while maintaining full backward compatibility with v1alpha1.
  - Add comprehensive field validation: matcher names (1-256 chars), values (max 1024 chars), minimum 1 matcher required.
  - Add printer columns to v1alpha2 CRD for better `kubectl get silences` output showing Age.
- Add automated migration script (`hack/migrate-silences.sh`) for v1alpha1 to v1alpha2 conversion.
  - Automatically converts boolean matcher fields (`isRegex`/`isEqual`) to enum format (`matchType`).
  - Intelligently preserves user annotations/labels while filtering out Kubernetes and FluxCD system metadata.
  - Supports dry-run mode for safe migration testing.
- Add comprehensive migration documentation (`MIGRATION.md`) with examples and best practices.
- Add clean service layer architecture (`pkg/service/`) separating business logic from Kubernetes controller concerns.

### Changed

- **BREAKING** (v1alpha2 only): Replace `isRegex` and `isEqual` boolean fields with single `matchType` enum field using Alertmanager symbols.
- **BREAKING** (v1alpha2 only): Change from cluster-scoped to namespace-scoped resources for better multi-tenancy and RBAC isolation.
- **BREAKING** (v1alpha2 only): Remove deprecated fields in v1alpha2: `targetTags`, `owner`, `postmortem_url`, and `issue_url` for cleaner API design.
- Improve code organization with dependency injection and clear separation between controller logic and business logic.

### Deprecated

- The `monitoring.giantswarm.io/v1alpha1` API is now considered legacy. New deployments should use `observability.giantswarm.io/v1alpha2`.

**Migration Note**: Existing v1alpha1 silences continue to work unchanged. Use the automated migration script and see MIGRATION.md for detailed guidance.

## [0.16.1] - 2025-05-20

- Remove duplicate container `securityContext` from the Helm chart deployment template.

## [0.16.0] - 2025-05-20

### Added

- Helm chart now supports conditional installation of the Silence CRD via the `crds.install` value. The CRD is templated and installed by default, but you can disable it by setting `crds.install` to `false`.

## [0.15.0] - 2025-05-14

### Added

- Migrate from Giant Swarm deprecated operatorkit framework to kube-builder.
- Add CiliumNetworkPolicy support.

### Changed

- Migrate from Giant Swarm deprecated `operatorkit` framework to `kube-builder`. This change introduces a few **breaking changes**:
  - Operator configuration has been moved from a configmap to command-line arguments. **This does not affect helm chart users**
  - The operator needs new rbac capabilities to be able manage `leases` and to create `events`
  - http port has been changed from 8000 to 8080.
  - Finalizers set on silences have been changed from `operatorkit.giantswarm.io/silence-operator-silence-controller` to `monitoring.giantswarm.io/silence-protection`
- **helm** `.registry.domain` has been renamed to `image.registry` (**breaking change**)
- **helm** deprecated PodSecurityPolicy has been removed (**breaking change** with kubernetes < 1.25)
- Use `app-build-suite` to build the operator.
- Changed container image from alpine to a non-root distroless image.

### Fixed

- Fixed the linting errors from golangci-lint v2.

### Removed

- Remove the unnecessary sync job to rely on GitOps. **Breaking change**: this means that you should now use your favorite GitOps tool (flux, ArgoCD) to deploy silences on your clusters.
- Removed Giant Swarm legacy `microerrors` package for error handling
