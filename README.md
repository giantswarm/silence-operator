# silence-operator

The Silence Operator automates the management of [Alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager) [silences](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/#silences) using Kubernetes Custom Resources. This allows you to define and manage silences declaratively, just like other Kubernetes objects, integrating them into your GitOps workflows.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.25+
- Helm 3+

## Get Helm Repository Info

```console
helm repo add giantswarm https://giantswarm.github.io/control-plane-catalog/
helm repo update
```

_See [`helm repo`](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_repo/) for command documentation._

## Install Helm Chart

```console
helm install [RELEASE_NAME] giantswarm/silence-operator
```

_See [helm install](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/) for command documentation._


CRDs are not created by this chart and should be manually deployed:

```console
kubectl apply --server-side -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giantswarm/silence-operator/main/config/crd/monitoring.giantswarm.io_silences.yaml
```

## Uninstall Helm Chart

```console
helm uninstall [RELEASE_NAME]
```

This removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

_See [helm uninstall](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) for command documentation._

CRDs are not removed by default and should be manually cleaned up:

```console
kubectl delete crd silences.monitoring.giantswarm.io
```

## Upgrading Chart

```console
helm upgrade [RELEASE_NAME] giantswarm/silence-operator
```

CRDs should be manually updated:

```
kubectl apply --server-side -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giantswarm/silence-operator/main/config/crd/monitoring.giantswarm.io_silences.yaml
```

_See [helm upgrade](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) for command documentation._

## Overview

### CustomResourceDefinition

The silence-operator monitors the Kubernetes API server for changes
to `Silence` objects and ensures that the current Alertmanager silences match these objects.
The Operator reconciles the `Silence` [Custom Resource Definition (CRD)][crd] which
can be found [here][silence-crd].

The `Silence` CRD generated at [config/crd/monitoring.giantswarm.io_silences.yaml](config/crd/monitoring.giantswarm.io_silences.yaml) is deployed via [management-cluster-bases](https://github.com/giantswarm/management-cluster-bases/blob/9e17d416dd324e07d7784054237302707ba42dc3/bases/crds/giantswarm/kustomization.yaml#L6C1-L7C1) repository.

[crd]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/extend-api-custom-resource-definitions/
[silence-crd]: api/v1alpha1/silence_types.go

### How does it work

Deployment runs the Kubernetes controller, which reconciles `Silence` CRs.

Sample CR:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.giantswarm.io/v1alpha1
kind: Silence
metadata:
  name: test-silence1
spec:
  matchers:
  - name: cluster
    value: test
    isRegex: false
```

- `matchers` field corresponds to the Alertmanager silence `matchers` each of which consists of:
  - `name` - name of tag on an alert to match
  - `value` - fixed string or expression to match against the value of the tag named by `name` above on an alert
  - `isRegex` - a boolean specifying whether to treat `value` as a regex (`=~`) or a fixed string (`=`)
  - `isEqual` - a boolean specifying whether to use equal signs (`=` or `=~`) or to negate the matcher (`!=` or `!~`)
